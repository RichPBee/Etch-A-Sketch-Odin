# Etch-A-Sketch-Odin
Etch-A-Sketch. 

Goals and Outlines: 
The aim here is to create a fully functional grid within a 960px square.
The grid squares should change with mouse-hover/mouse-over events. 
Buttons should be able to change between a light/dark theme, or wipe the grid
there should be a slider for grid size and a method for selecting a colour
to paint with.
In addition, there should be different "modes" of painting, including
random RGB, a selected colour or an eraser.

Steps are as follows: 
1. Build basic GUI wireframe - including all buttons and slider that will be in the 
final version. 

2. Add CSS styling - design final webpage look and feel

3. Add basic JS functionality - first mono-colour variant should work at this point

4. Add JS for more complex functionality - i.e. size slider, RGB randomizer. 

5. Finishing touches with colour selector & final CSS styling.
